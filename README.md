# CSCI70 Final Exam Bonus Question (Merge Sort in Go)

The code contained in the merge_sort.go file can be run directly from the website https://go.dev/play/, an online service owned and operated by Go that compiles code online, but is unable to take in direct input from the command line. 
In order to specify input for the merge sort function, please edit the values in the list declaration contained in line 41 of the code!
